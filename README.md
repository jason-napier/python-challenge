# Python Challenge

Welcome to my `python-challenge` repository! This repository showcases my Python scripting skills through two distinct projects: PyBank and PyPoll. Each project tackles a real-world scenario, utilizing Python to analyze and interpret data, demonstrating my ability to handle practical data processing tasks. 

## Projects Overview

### PyBank

**Objective:** Analyze financial records of a company using a dataset (`budget_data.csv`) composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Data Analysis:** Computing net totals, average changes, and identifying significant financial changes.
- **Python Scripting:** Utilizing Python for reading CSV files, performing calculations, and writing output to text files.
- **Problem Solving:** Implementing efficient logic to analyze financial data and derive meaningful insights.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- CSV module for file operations

**Results:**
- Calculated the total number of months, net total amount of "Profit/Losses", average change in "Profit/Losses", and identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits.

### PyPoll

**Objective:** Assist a small, rural town in modernizing its vote-counting process by analyzing a set of poll data (`election_data.csv`) with columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Election Analysis:** Calculating total votes, vote percentages, and identifying the election winner.
- **Python Scripting:** Expertise in reading CSV files, data aggregation, and output formatting.
- **Data Handling:** Efficiently managing and interpreting large datasets, showcasing an alternative to Excel-based analysis.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- CSV module for handling CSV file operations

**Results:**
- Analyzed total votes cast, computed each candidate's percentage of votes and total votes, and determined the election winner based on popular vote.
